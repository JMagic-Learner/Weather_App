## Weather Application

        
## Description
        Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Weather Application.


        Personal Motivation:
       This is a homework assignment from UW Bootcamp. It is designed to utilize and demonstrate knowledge of third party APIs. 

        Project Goal / Purpose
       This project uses an API called OpenWeather. By using a API key, we can request data from third party APIs and display the data here in this application. For example this application uses OpenWeather forecast to display weather data for cities around the world.

        Coding Process
       The coding process is done block by block. We first build the HTML structure as outlined in the coding prompt. After assigning DIV, Classes, Objects to display the API data, we then build CSS to "block-in" visual colors and structure. We then use Javascript to call the API and display the data.

 ## Credits
        Enter a city name into the search bar to populate the data. The data should show temperature, UV, precipitation, etc for every city. The toolbars on the left of the screen allow you to test out preset cities. It also allows you to use the previous city as (storage).
